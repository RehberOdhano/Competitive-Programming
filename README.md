## Overview

This repository serves as a personal archive of competitive programming solutions, algorithmic problem-solving approaches, and contest submissions. Solutions are organized by topic, platform, and contest for easy reference and learning.

## Languages & Tools

- **C++** (Primary) - Most solutions implemented in C++ for optimal performance in competitive programming environments
- **Java** - Selected problems solved using Java for platform-specific requirements
- **Python** - Occasional solutions in Python for rapid prototyping

**Compilation Tools:**

- GCC/Clang with C++11+ support
- JDK 8+ for Java solutions
- Python 3.x interpreter

## Topics Covered

### Arrays & String Manipulation

- Finding second largest element (multiple approaches)
- Array rotation (clockwise and counter-clockwise)
- Target sum problems (pairs, triplets)
- Subarray problems (sum, average, maximum)
- Array segregation and sorting
- Prefix sums and range queries
- Element frequency and occurrence counting

### Algorithms & Data Structures

- **Two-Pointers Technique** - Efficient array/string traversal
- **Sliding Window** - Optimal subarray/substring problems
- **Hash Maps / Unordered Maps** - Fast lookups and frequency tracking
- **Set Operations** - Unique element handling
- **String Processing** - Pattern matching and manipulation

### Problem Categories

- **Array Problems**: Rotation, searching, sorting, partitioning, range queries
- **String Problems**: Palindromes, longest substring, character frequency analysis
- **Subarray Problems**: Sum equals K, maximum average, sliding window optimizations
- **Contest Problems**: Google CodeJam, Google Kickstart algorithmic challenges
